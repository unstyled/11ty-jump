Managing Engineers began as a candid conversation between Adrian and Si—two engineering leaders comparing notes on how to support their teams while navigating the constantly shifting tech landscape. The first two episodes capture that energy, highlighting the realities of leading people through career changes, reorganisations, and the day-to-day demands of delivering software.

## Season 1: Setting the Scene

- **Episode 1 – Adrian & Si:** An open discussion on what it really means to manage engineers today, the challenges of staying hands-on, and the importance of building trust.
- **Episode 2 – Adrian & Si:** Continuing the dialogue with lessons from their own teams, touching on hiring, growing careers, and adapting to change.

Although career moves paused production after those initial episodes, the appetite for honest conversations about engineering leadership never went away.

## Season 2: Returning with Fresh Perspectives

Si is now joined by engineering leader **Neil Younger** for a ten-episode deep dive into managing software engineers across the industry. Together they will:

- Compare approaches to coaching, feedback, and performance.
- Learn more about each other’s backgrounds and leadership styles.
- Invite friends and peers to share their experiences.
- Offer practical tips listeners can bring back to their own teams.

Whether you are an aspiring manager or a seasoned head of engineering, Season 2 promises thoughtful stories, practical frameworks, and space to reflect on the human side of building software.
