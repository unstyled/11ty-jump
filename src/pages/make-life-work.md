Make Life Work began as a simple idea: invite creative technologists to share how they balance personal passions with professional life. When lockdown hit in season two, the conversations quickly evolved, offering a candid look at how people navigated an entirely new world of remote work, family commitments, and disrupted routines.

Across ten seasons, Si Jobling has welcomed an incredible variety of guestsâ€”from early web standards pioneers such as Andy Clarke, Chris Heilmann, and Brian Suda, to innovators like Michele Hanson, Shannon Almeida, and Dustin Miller. He has also caught up with ASOS alumni James Norton, AJ Wilson, and Lewis Prescott, plus familiar faces from the On The Side community including Mike Street, Sam Hardacre, and Dom Hodgson.

The show is a deep dive into personal projects, the realities of creative side hustles, and the constant juggle between family time and fulfilling work. Whether you are launching a new idea or looking to rekindle an old one, Make Life Work offers honest stories, practical tips, and plenty of encouragement.
